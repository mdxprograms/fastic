### requirements
`python 3`
`docker`

### setup
```bash
make create-venv && echo "DEBUG=True" > .env
```

### run dev
`make dev`

### run build
`make build`

### Using Collections
If you have a need for collections you can specify the folder within `config.py`

Example: `collections = ['products']`

This will grab all `.md` files within `pages/products` and add them to the
`collections` dict to use in your templates.

Assuming there would be a `title` frontmatter property in a products collection file.
```jinja2
{% for product in collections.products %}
  <h3>{{ product.title }}</h3>
{% endfor %}
```
